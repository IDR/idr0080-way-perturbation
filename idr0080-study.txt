Study Description	Genetic and chemical perturbations impact diverse cellular phenotypes, including multiple indicators of cell health. These readouts reveal toxicity and antitumorigenic effects relevant to drug discovery and personalized medicine. We present an approach to predict multiple cell health phenotypes using Cell Painting, an inexpensive and scalable image-based morphology assay. In matched CRISPR perturbations of three cancer cell lines, we collected both Cell Painting data and targeted assay readouts from seven reagents that measure specific cell health phenotypes including proliferation, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage, and aberrant cell cycle stage progression. We showed many of these targeted readouts, which are expensive and tedious to acquire and measure, can be predicted directly from Cell Painting images by simple machine learning algorithms. We hypothesized that these trained models can be applied to accurately predict cell health assay outcomes for any future or existing Cell Painting dataset. We applied the models to a set of 1,500+ compound perturbations across multiple doses and validated the predictions by orthogonal assay readouts, and by confirming mitotic arrest and ROS phenotypes via PLK and proteasome inhibition, respectively. We provide an intuitive web app to browse all predictions at http://broad.io/cell-health-app. Our approach can be extended to other morphology data collected in other batches or by other labs to enable rapid and inexpensive cell health predictions from images.

Protocol Description	We determined growth conditions for each Cas9- expressing cell line independently to achieve 90% confluence after five days of lentiviral infection at CRISPR infection day five.  Starting cell densities per well: A549 - 350,  ES2 - 375, and HCC44 - 150 cells.  	We optimized sgRNA lentivirus volume and polybrene concentration for each plate independently.  	We selected genes that are known to induce viability differences in cancer cell lines, and to span multiple biological pathways.  	We used CellProfiler to extract morphology features,Complete downstream processing details are available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/cell-health
